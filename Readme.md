# SP Representation

This project is a web-based application designed to convert decimal numbers into their IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point representation. It provides an educational tool for understanding how decimal numbers are represented in binary format according to the IEEE 754 standard.

## Features

- Converts decimal numbers to IEEE 754 single-precision format.
- Displays the sign, exponent, and mantissa components separately.
- Provides a visual representation of the binary format.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RITIKSINGH-DEOS/SP-Representation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SP-Representation
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to access the application.

4. **Convert a Number**:
   - Enter a decimal number into the input field.
   - Click the "Convert" button to see its IEEE 754 single-precision representation.
